## Context

- **Command:** `poker-cli` (assumed installed and on PATH)
- **Source:** `~/dev/poker-cli`
- **Hand files:** `~/dev/pokernow/hands/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- **Tests:** 139 tests, ~92% line coverage. `cargo test` / `cargo llvm-cov`

## Commands

### stats — Player Statistics

```bash
poker-cli stats [files...]
poker-cli stats                              # uses config.toml files
poker-cli stats session1.json session2.json  # explicit files
```

Per-player output ranked by P&L: VPIP, PFR, 3-Bet%, Fold-to-3B%, Cold Call%, C-Bet%, Fold-to-CB%, AF, WTSD%, W$SD%, All-in EV, positional breakdowns (EP/MP/CO/BTN/SB/BB), net P&L in BB, BB/hand. Multi-file merges stats across sessions.

### hand — Hand Replay

```bash
poker-cli hand <id> [files...]
poker-cli hand 43 session.json               # by sequential number (1-based)
poker-cli hand nyamg3i3yuit session.json     # by PokerNow hash ID
```

Street-by-street replay with:
- Visible hole cards for all shown players
- Each action with amounts and pot-relative sizing (e.g., "bets 22 (67% pot)")
- Board cards and running pot
- Made hand descriptions at each street (e.g., "flush, ace-high", "top pair, queens", "open-ended straight draw")
- Final result with winner and amount

Accepts sequential hand number (1-based) or PokerNow hash ID. On invalid ID, lists all available IDs.

### search — Hand Search/Filter

```bash
poker-cli search [filters...] [files...]
poker-cli search --player Andrew --min-pot 100 --showdown session.json
poker-cli search --saw-flop Andrew --sort pot session.json
```

**Filters:**
- `--player <name>` — player VPIP'd (voluntarily put money in)
- `--saw-flop <name>` — player saw the flop
- `--saw-turn <name>` — player saw the turn
- `--saw-river <name>` — player saw the river
- `--min-pot <bb>` — minimum pot size in BB
- `--max-pot <bb>` — maximum pot size in BB
- `--showdown` — only showdown hands
- `--no-showdown` — only non-showdown hands
- `--sort pot` — sort by pot size descending (default: hand number)

Output: hand number, pot size (BB), showdown status, winner, amount won.

### Global Flags

```bash
poker-cli --unify-players "pranav,pranavv;Steve,steveooooo" stats session.json
```

- `--unify-players <groups>` — merge player identities. First name = canonical. Semicolons separate groups. Overrides config.toml `[unify]`.

## Config File

Create `config.toml` in the directory where you run `poker-cli`. Eliminates repetitive CLI args.

```toml
# Default hand history files (supports ~ expansion)
files = [
  "~/dev/pokernow/hands/2026-03-11.json",
  "~/dev/pokernow/hands/2026-03-10.json",
  "~/dev/pokernow/hands/2026-03-08.json",
  "~/dev/pokernow/hands/2026-03-07.json",
  "~/dev/pokernow/hands/2026-03-06.json",
  "~/dev/pokernow/hands/2026-02-23.json",
]

# Player unification — key is canonical name, value is list of aliases
[unify]
pranav = ["pranav", "pranavv"]
```

**Precedence:** CLI args override config.toml. If files given on CLI, config `files` ignored. If `--unify-players` passed, config `[unify]` ignored.

## What Gets Filtered

Only standard Texas Hold'em is processed. Silently skipped:
- Omaha hands (`gameType != "th"`)
- Bomb pots (`bombPot: true`)
- Double-board games (no type 14 RIT vote event)

Run-it-twice hands are fully supported — first run's board used for stats/eval, hand replay shows both runs.

## Stat Definitions

- **VPIP** — Voluntarily put money in preflop (call or raise, excludes forced bets)
- **PFR** — Preflop raise
- **3-Bet%** — Re-raise preflop (second raise)
- **Fold-to-3B** — Folded after opening and facing a 3-bet
- **Cold Call%** — Called a raise without having previously put money in
- **C-Bet%** — Continuation bet (first flop bet by preflop aggressor)
- **Fold-to-CB** — Folded facing a c-bet
- **AF** — Aggression Factor: postflop (bets + raises) / calls
- **WTSD%** — Went to showdown / saw flop
- **W$SD%** — Won money at showdown / went to showdown
- **All-in EV** — Expected value in all-in situations vs observed result

## Workflow Patterns

**Session review:** Run `stats` first for the overview, then `search --sort pot` to find interesting hands, then `hand <id>` to replay them.

**Player investigation:** `search --player X --min-pot 50` to find hands a player was involved in, then replay specific hands.

**Cross-session comparison:** Pass multiple JSON files to `stats` to aggregate. Use `--unify-players` or config `[unify]` if players changed names between sessions.

**Pre-game prep:** Load all sessions with regulars to review opponent tendencies. Focus on VPIP-PFR gap, fold-to-3bet, and c-bet frequency.

## Notes

- Pot sizes are in big blinds throughout
- Player name matching is case-sensitive
- Hand descriptions are contextual for Hold'em (overpair, top pair, flush draw, nut flush draw, etc.)
- Sequential hand numbers are 1-based (hand 1 = first hand in the file)
- Multi-file stats merge across all files; hand/search operate on the combined hand list
